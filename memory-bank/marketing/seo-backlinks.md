## Key Learnings

1. **Ahrefs DR updates every ~2 weeks** - patience required
2. **One DR 70+ link > fifty DR 15 links** - prioritize quality
3. **Pay to skip gatekeeping** - Startupfa.me monthly was worth it vs waiting
4. **Force indexing** - Submit backlink URLs to Ahrefs Webmaster Tools

## Next Actions

1. [ ] Product Hunt launch (biggest single DR boost)
2. [ ] Post on Indie Hackers
3. [ ] Submit to AlternativeTo
4. [ ] Sign up for HARO/Connectively
5. [ ] Verify site in Ahrefs Webmaster Tools (speeds up crawling)
