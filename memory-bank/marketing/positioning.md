# Inkdex Positioning & Messaging Guide

## Core Value Proposition

**Instagram is for sharing. Inkdex is for getting booked.**

### The Insight

- Tattoo artists live on Instagram - their portfolios, their audience, their identity
- Instagram's algorithm optimizes for **engagement** (time on app), not **discovery**
- Artists want: clients, bookings, money for their art
- Clients want: to find the right artist for their vision
- Instagram serves neither goal well

### The Solution

Inkdex is a **discovery layer on top of Instagram**. Artists keep doing what they do on Instagram. We surface them to users with **booking intent**.

---

## Messaging Framework

### Positioning Statement

For tattoo clients who know what they want but not who can do it, Inkdex is a visual search platform that finds artists based on their actual work - not hashtags or algorithms. Unlike Instagram search or Google, Inkdex lets users upload a reference image and see artists whose portfolios match that style.

### Taglines

**For Users:**
- "Instagram has your artist. We help you find them."
- "Stop scrolling hashtags. Start finding artists."
- "You know it when you see it. So do we."

**For Artists:**
- "Instagram is for sharing. Inkdex is for getting booked."
- "Your work speaks. We make sure clients hear it."
- "Stay on Instagram. Get discovered everywhere."

### Key Messages

**For Users:**
1. Search by image, not by hashtag
2. Find artists who match your vibe, not algorithms
3. Your reference image leads to artists who can execute it

**For Artists:**
1. Inkdex doesn't replace Instagram - it amplifies it
2. We send you clients with booking intent, not engagement bait
3. Your portfolio already exists; we make it discoverable

## Tone & Voice

### Complementary, Not Competitive

- **DO:** "Instagram + Inkdex" framing
- **DON'T:** Attack Instagram directly
- **Example:** "You're already building your portfolio on Instagram. Inkdex helps the right clients find it."

### Direct & Confident

- No hedging ("might help", "could find")
- Specific claims ("clients searching for your style" vs "more exposure")
- Numbers when possible (16,000+ artists, 147 cities)

### Builder-to-Builder (for artists)

- Respect their craft and hustle
- Acknowledge Instagram is essential to their business
- Position Inkdex as a tool, not a replacement
