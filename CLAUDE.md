# CLAUDE AI ASSISTANT RULES

## MEMORY BANK – START PROCEDURE

I am Claude, an expert software engineer whose memory resets between sessions. The memory bank is the single source of truth that gets me back up to speed. Read only what is required, keep it lean, and update it when reality changes.

### Memory Bank Layout
```
core/           → must-read startup context
development/    → active engineering focus + operations
architecture/   → current system map + approved patterns
archive/        → historical narrative and deprecated guidance
```

### Core Files (Read In Order)
1. `/memory-bank/core/quickstart.md` – one-page situational awareness + commands
2. `/memory-bank/core/projectbrief.md` – enduring product promise and scope
3. `/memory-bank/development/activeContext.md` – current sprint goals + blockers
4. `/memory-bank/development/progress.md` – quarterly highlights of shipped work
5. `/memory-bank/architecture/techStack.md` – current stack, deployments, references
6. `/memory-bank/development/operations.md` – quality gates and process expectations

Read additional docs only if needed (`architecture/patterns.md`, `development/daily-log/`, etc.). Long-form history now lives under `memory-bank/archive/` and is optional.

**Archive Contents:**
- `archive/phase-0-4-implementation.md` - Detailed Phase 0-4 history (Dec 29-31, 2025) with implementation notes, lessons learned, and troubleshooting

### Documentation Updates
Update the memory bank when:
- You finish a feature or change operational flow.
- Architecture/tooling shifts (new dependency, command, deployment change).
- You discover a pattern that should guide future work.

Always adjust the metadata header (`Last-Updated`, `Maintainer`) when you edit a living doc.

## BEHAVIORAL RULES

### Communication & Decision Making
- Ask before making major feature or architecture changes.
- Get approval before adding dependencies or altering core workflows.
- Explain your reasoning when proposing changes; surface trade-offs early.

### Minimal First Implementation
1. Ask: "What is the smallest change that solves this?"
2. Implement only that minimum.
3. Stop and check in before layering abstractions, helpers, or advanced error handling.
4. Follow KISS and YAGNI—do not build for hypothetical futures without explicit direction.

## SUBAGENTS & DELEGATION

### Available Specialized Subagents
- **code-reviewer**: Proactive code quality, security, and maintainability reviews
  - Use after: Writing new features, refactoring, fixing bugs
  - Focus: Git diff analysis, security issues, code quality, testing
  - Tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash
  - Output: Prioritized feedback (Critical/Warning/Suggestion)

- **backend-architect**: Backend system design and architecture guidance
  - Use for: API design, database architecture, scaling decisions
  - Expertise: Microservices, security, performance optimization
  - Stack: Node.js, Python, PostgreSQL, Redis

- **frontend-developer**: Elite frontend specialist for modern web development
  - Use for: UI implementation, state management, performance optimization
  - Expertise: Component architecture, responsive design, accessibility (WCAG)
  - Tools: Write, Read, MultiEdit, Bash, Grep, Glob
  - Focus: Modern frameworks, bundle optimization, browser testing

- **ui-designer**: Visionary UI designer for rapid, implementable interfaces  
  - Use for: Interface design, design systems, visual aesthetics
  - Expertise: Modern design trends, responsive layouts
  - Tools: Write, Read, MultiEdit, WebSearch, WebFetch
  - Focus: Component library integration, user experience

### Delegation Triggers
1. **Automatic Review**: After implementing features or fixes, delegate to `code-reviewer`
2. **Architecture Review**: Before implementing backend changes, database queries, or auth modifications, consult `backend-architect`
3. **Frontend Implementation**: For complex UI work, state management, or performance issues, delegate to `frontend-developer`
4. **UI Design & Systems**: For interface design, visual improvements, or design system work, delegate to `ui-designer`
5. **Complex Research**: Use general-purpose subagent for multi-step investigations
6. **Reference Generation**: Use subagents to create documentation or architectural diagrams

### Integration Workflow
- **NEW BACKEND FEATURES**: 
  1. Consult backend-architect BEFORE coding
  2. Implement following architectural guidelines
  3. Measure performance impact
  4. Delegate to code-reviewer → Address feedback
- **FRONTEND FEATURES**: Use frontend-developer → Implement → Test → code-reviewer
- **UI DESIGN**: Use ui-designer → Create mockups/wireframes → frontend-developer → code-reviewer  
- **ALL CHANGES**: Complete implementation → Run quality checks → Delegate to code-reviewer → Address feedback
- Document significant subagent recommendations in memory bank

## ARCHITECTURE GROUND TRUTH

### Project Structure
- Follow established patterns in the codebase
- Maintain consistent file organization and naming conventions
- Keep configuration centralized and environment-specific

### Component Development
- Build reusable, composable components
- Follow existing component patterns and conventions
- Maintain clear separation of concerns
- Document component APIs and usage patterns

### Quality & Performance
- Write clean, maintainable code
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Optimize for performance and maintainability
- Test thoroughly before deployment

## PERFORMANCE & QUALITY

### Quality Gates
- Run linting and type checking before handoff
- Test changes thoroughly and report results
- Use `code-reviewer` subagent after significant code changes; address Critical issues before handoff
- Keep diffs surgical—strip logs, commented code, and unused exports
- Update docs as part of the definition of done; long narratives move to `archive/`
- Document significant subagent feedback in commit messages or memory bank when relevant
- **SQL migrations**: Always run `npm run db:push` (lints with sqlfluff first) instead of raw `npx supabase db push`
- **SQL naming**: Follow CTE column prefixes (`ri_`, `aa_`, `fa_`, `ba_`) - see `operations.md` for details
- **Search functions**: NEVER create new migrations that rewrite search functions. Edit `supabase/functions/search_functions.sql` instead (single source of truth)

### Performance Guidelines
- Follow established performance patterns
- Monitor and measure performance impact of changes
- Optimize for user experience and system efficiency
- Document performance considerations
- **ALWAYS parallelize and batch operations by default. Serial execution is ONLY for initial testing, then immediately switch to parallel/batch for production runs.**

## PROCESS REMINDERS

- Respect existing component patterns; search the repo before inventing new abstractions
- Follow established code style and conventions
- Coordinate via `development/daily-log/` for deep-dive debugging or incident notes
- Use subagents proactively for their specialized domains
- Backend changes should leverage `backend-architect` for architecture decisions before implementation
- When unsure, ask. Surprises slow the team more than questions

Stay focused, keep the memory bank tight, and maintain fast feedback loops.
